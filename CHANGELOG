C CHANGELOG :
C *** 1.0   *** - Original version
C *** 1.1   *** - Support for fchk files
C *** 1.1.1 *** - N-(De)loc indices expansion up to 14
C                 (looporb files not included)
C               - Small changes and bug fixes
C *** 1.1.2 *** - Memory use in subroutine "connect" reduced removing a
C                 dispensable array
C *** 1.1.3 *** - Sort atoms in the ring according to the connectivity.
C                 This allows to easily implement Giambiagi's indices.
C *** 1.2   *** - Giambiagi index implementation full implemented. The
C                 program is able to calculate Giambiagi's indices only.
C *** 1.2.1 *** - Giambiagi index with full sorting in all cases.
C *** 1.2.2 *** - Total summation of 2-(de)loc indices was added.
C *** 1.2.3 *** - BUGFIX :  Percentage calculation in "Ponec part".
C               - Short texts added in "results" to distinguish the 
C                 2-(de)loc indices.
C                 The new texts are "LOC :" and "DELOC :".
C               - Total number of specificied atoms added in the output
C *** 1.2.4 *** - BUGFIX :  In molecules with different size rings (4,6,
C                 ..., the detection process worked inappropriately 
C                 since there were atoms with one bond in the ring-con-
C                 nectivity matrix. These possible cases are skipped.
C *** 1.2.5 *** - Included ndeloc.param.h (settings).
C               - Output file is opened in subroutine "results".
C *** 1.2.6 *** - First version using CMake.
C *** 1.2.7 *** - First support for unrestricted calculations.
C *** 1.2.8 *** - Choose the length of atomlabel (X1,X01,X001, ...)
C *** 1.2.9 *** - XYZ files for Chemcraft with N-deloc indices if ring
C                 and xyz options are employed.
C *** 1.2.10 ** - Added the possibility of using ranges with '-',
C                 e.g., "1-10,14" when the atoms are specified in the
C                 corresponding section.
C               - Added the numerical specification for MO section 
C                 (1-10,43).
C *** 1.2.11 ** - Support for eloc format (STOCK program). Bugfixes
C *** 1.2.12 ** - Sigma contribution is up to now calculated if required.
C               - OpenMP parallelization according to mulldeloc scheme.
C               - Main CMakelist.txt updated.
C *** 1.2.13 ** - Support for Multiwfn atomic overlap matrices with Multiwfn (AOM.txt)
C *** 1.2.14 ** - Support for Multiwfn basin overlap matrices with Multiwfn (BOM.txt)
C *** 1.2.15 ** - Use of occupation numbers to scale overlap matrices. Put parallelization in low indices.
C 		- AIMAll int file names are automatically generated.
C               - looptree expanded up to 14-deloc indices.
C               - Parallelization revised.
C               - 'debug' mode can be set from the 1st input line adding the word 'debug'
C               - Bug fixes.
C 		- New progress bar.
C *** 1.2.16 ** - Important bug fix to avoid problems with arrays using stack memory.
C               - CMake changed. We remove the command "set" to force compilers.
C                 cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=compiler instead
C               - Localization indices fix to use parallelization.
C               - .sg format support for SIGMA/PI identification.
C               - Help message update to avoid problems with ifort and a limit of text length.
C *** 1.2.17 ** - Quicksort updated. Parallelized version, from JAMS Fortran library.
C               - REFs and authors included as comments and in the output file.
